# basic-calculator
A calculator, inspired from the last one i made, unlike my last calculator which only performed addition, this one has operations like subtraction, multiplication and division operations too.


just copy-paste the code in your python ide, and ru it, you are ready to go,
first it will ask you to choose the operation you want to perform,you choose the operation by the assigned number respectively
and the it will display what operation you chose and will ask you to enter first number,
then after entering your first number it will ask you to enter your second number
# note: this calculator is designed to perform the 4 mentioned operations between two numbers only,in future i'll make a calculator the will perform various operations with as much inputs the user wants

after you enter your second number it will show the result of the operation you chose earlier.

# this calculator takes input in form of float.
